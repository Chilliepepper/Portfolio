             Still not enough text, I can do this all day. Not really I have better things to do just type random words hankie grass snakes theres a snake in my boot woods buz howdy howdy howdy. What is my brain how did I end up here. I just looked at the title of this project and could have sworn it said porn which is really weird weird is a weird word. Butterfly buterfly in the sky I can fly twice as high just take a look it in a book its reading rainbow. What a weird show but I have such fond memories of it. How long must this go on, 
             this cruel trick of fate, I simply made one careless wrong decision and then the witch was gone and left me in this STATE and object of revulsion and derision haaated is there nooone who can shooow me how to win the worlds fooorgiiiiveness. Dude I'm pretty sure you just need to earn the witch/faries forgivness. I recently watched a musical and while watching there was a line that was also part of a song from les mis and I started singing it. What if there was a game where you started to watch on musical and the second someone found a line from a different musical you went to that line in the other musical 
             and watched from that point till someone found another line, etc. how long would it last?
